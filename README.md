Code Institute Band project website by Simon Clew

Introduction

I chose to create my own project outside of the brief. However I stayed within the specification of the project. I however add some extra functions in order to show the actual musician (a prospect) how a re-worked site may look. 
The Home page is designed to be as simple as possible There is actually no text other than the Jumbotron with the strapline. This is intentional, over 70% of users come to the current site from youtube, therefore cluttering up the page with volumes of text attempting to write good keywords is impractical for a musician of this type (Celtic Folk music) and a site at this stage of development.

The site is hopefully an extension of the artist and their music over a busy site with lots of adverts and links.

The menu is a standard boostrap  menu with the collapsing function for mobile deployment. 

The Audio Page has a selection of albums and offers the user chances to listen or purchase via Google Play. In the real world this would be extended to i-tunes and ability to purchase CD’s directly.

The Video Page offers 4 different videos of the musician, which have embedded links to Youtube. 

The Live Page has a selection of upcoming concerts and links to the venues for extra information.

Collaborations has a drop-down for a musical collaboration with another musician and information about the musicians collaboration with PRS guitars.

Finally, Workshops has information and dates on collaborative workshops  

The footer has links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. I used the Font Awesome iconography. I do not see the need to add text to the icons. The orinal code for the footer came from the resume project. I used the font awesome icons here and changed the position and size.
A subscribe to newsletter options also resides in the footer. This is not connected to anything currently, merely the bootstrap standard mail form.
coding style tests

The way columns wrap in bootstrap mean I needed to code the Audio page the way I have in order for the titles and info above and below the images to stay in place at different screen resolutions.

I used Google Chrome Inspector and dev tools to make changes to my CSS and paste those back into my c9 CSS.
I continually tested the site at different screen resolutions using Chrome dev tools to do so.
